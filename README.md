A new Flutter project.

## Ideas for Improvment.
    1. Alert Dialogs || Snackbars (Where needed).
    2. Adding a Json file with a List of Cities/Countries? (User can Pick from)
    3. Checking if a user has internet connection before going out to fetch data.
    4. Navigating user to App Settings on Mobile if location Permissions is set to denied_forever.(Check todo)
       -Should only navigate user if user is using a mobile device *not on web*!.
    5. Test app on webb.

Ok, that's it.. I'm out of idea's (for now...ðŸ˜…).
